She travels with the speed of wind from one end of the world to the other.

# iris-react

This is a web front-end written in React/Redux which is used as part of the Digital Business Platform project.

This developer portal is intended to manage (publication and consumption of) APIs and respective users (publishers/consumers).

# Installation

Execute the following command to install all dependencies:

`npm i`

Launch the node server:

`npm start`

# Start playing

# Mock server

The actual server is still a work-in-progress.

In the meantime a [mock server](https://github.com/bidispot/iris-be-mock) has been implemented:

The current implementation of iris-rect expects this mock server to run at port 3100.
